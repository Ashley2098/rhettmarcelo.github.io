    My name is Rhett Marcelo, a student from the University of Houston - Downtown. I have always wondered how things work, even with the simplest ones. My parents had
    enlightened me that was inquisitive enough to be a scientist, a trait of a scientist that questions
    everything. They decided for me to be one. Before going to college, I mentioned to my parents
    that I am going to be an Engineer, and not a scientist like they wanted me to be. I explained that
    my goal is to apply everything I know to improve a certain entity that will make something more
    useful in the future. I continued that a Scientist is the one who discovers the laws, and the
    Engineer will create something based on the laws the scientist has discovered, by developing
    technology, which makes him an Application Scientist. I ended that they should still be happy
    since I will still be the scientist, they dreamed me to be, just a different title. After 7 years in the
    making, I found myself fascinated with computers as I work with them daily and finally decided
    to be part of the Computer Science field for the cardinal reasons: I am not contented with what I
    know and desire to improve my understanding in computers to a whole academic level. <br><br>
    
    I wanted to improve and apply the methodological processes I have learned from school
    while aiming to contribute to the field of artificial intelligence. My junior experience is
    advantageous, as I am easily moldable according to the right type of intern the laboratory needs.
    I would like to participate in full data analyses, and algorithm modifications will be part of my
    routine to be confident in handling large datasets as this would be beneficial in being an efficient
    computer scientist. Using what I learned from school in algorithms and mathematics, in addition
    with this internship, a goal of mine would be to develop, apply, and improve an unsupervised
    machine learning model that predicts and identifies early diseases, using the supercomputers in
    collaboration of experts within the medical field. This current pandemic has claimed the lives of
    people who are close to me, mostly due to the negligence that they are carrying the disease
    without their knowledge. I plan to deploy the project in an affordable manner to third world and
    impoverished countries with hopes to abate the mortality rates of current and future diseases. <br><br>

    Learning is a lifetime process, and I want to append my current computer science and
    engineering knowledge with a goal to familiarize myself with the applications of parallel
    computing for machine learning. Therefore, a long-term objective of mine is to pursue graduate
    school, obtain the necessary experience to conduct proper research, co-publish high-impact
    papers that can contribute to improve our quality of life, and learn how to teach future students
    what the applications of machine learning is all about in the simplest manner possible. <br><br>
